# Socket-Based Shopping Cart in C

A client-server based shopping application developed in **C** using **TCP sockets**. The system allows multiple clients to connect to a centralized server concurrently using **POSIX threads**, view product catalog, add items to cart, update user account, place orders, and persist session data. Thread safety is ensured using **mutex locks**, and all session data is stored using basic file I/O.
